Syntax Error:

Definition: A syntax error occurs when the syntax (grammar and structure) of your code does not conform to the rules of the programming language.
Cause: This usually happens when you mistype a keyword, forget to close a parenthesis, use incorrect punctuation, or violate any other syntactical rules defined by the language.
Detection: Syntax errors are typically caught by the TypeScript compiler (or interpreter in other languages) during the compilation (or interpretation) phase, before the code is executed.
